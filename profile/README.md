🗺️📱 **About Our Project**

Our project aims to create an intelligent itinerary tool by leveraging predictions from our machine learning model, cloud computing technologies, and an android application as our main user interface. Traveling can be overwhelming when users want to visit many attractions in a limited amount of time. Our goal is to address this problem by developing a system that generates efficient itineraries based on destination locations, duration of stay, destination opening hours, and customization features. 

By utilizing clustering techniques and optimization algorithms, our application will recommend the best sequence of tourist attractions each day to ensure users maximize their trip. This project addresses the growing demand for effective travel solutions especially as tourism rebounds after the pandemic. Our team is excited to tackle this challenge as we believe that it offers a unique opportunity to blend different technologies with tourism that will help users enjoy stress-free and organized travel while exploring new destinations.
